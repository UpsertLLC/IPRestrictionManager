# Upsert速 IP Restriction Manager

The Upsert速 IP Restriction Manager plugin allows a Sugar administrator to setup restrictive ip ranges for authentication. These ranges can be specific to a user, team, role or combination of all three. IP ranges can be specified in the following formats: specific, wildcard, CIDR and Start-End

For building the plugin and usage, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/UpsertLLC/IPRestrictionManager/wiki). The latest pre-built package can be downloaded from [here](https://upsertconsulting.com/plugins/ip-restriction-manager/).
